I need to like redo all the "entab" and "detab" programs from chapter 1 and chapter 5 because 
I thought I was doing them the right way but turns out I actually misread the directions or somehow 
misunderstood the exercise even though I thought I was doing them right.  So I'm just gonna either not 
do them right now, or forget about them or something.
